AKM AK8963 3-axis electronic compass driver

Required properties:

 - compatible		: Should be "ak,ak8963".
 - reg				: i2c address of the device.
 - interrupt-parent : Parent of interrupt.
 - interrupts		: Ecompass interrupt to indicate new data ready.
 - vdd-supply		: Analog power supply needed to power up the device.
 - vio-supply		: Digital IO power supply needed for IO and I2C.
 - akm,layout		: The layout of the ecompass sensor chip. There are 8
	patterns of layout described as below:
	0: Indicate the invalid pattern, The userspace will decide the pattern.
	1: 1st pin is right down
	2: 1st pin is left down
	3: 1st pin is left top
	4: 1st pin is right top
	5: 1st pin is left down (from top view)
	6: 1st pin is left top (from top view)
	7: 1st pin is right top (from top view)
	8: 1st pin is right down (from top view)
 - akm,gpio_rstn	: The gpio pin to reset the sensor chip.

 Example:
	akm@c {
			compatible = "ak,ak8963";
			reg = <0x0c>;
			interrupt-parent = <&msmgpio>;
			interrupts = <83 0x2>;
			vdd-supply = <&pm8110_l19>;
			vio-supply = <&pm8110_l14>;
			akm,layout = <0x0>;
			akm,gpio_rstn = <&msmgpio 82 0x0>;
	};
